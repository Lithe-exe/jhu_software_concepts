This decision should not be taken as a sign that our readers did not enjoy reading your work: due to this year's budgetary restrictions, we have been unable to admit dozens of candidates who could thrive at the graduate level. In the end, we admitted fewer than 10% of the applicants for graduate study in our department, making this an especially competitive admissions cycle. \nWe hope that you will be able to pursue your goals for advanced study in another context, and we wish you the very best success in your scholarly or creative endeavors. Many thanks for your interest in our program, and for all of the time and energy that you put into your application.",

One of them (the senior and very aged one) asked a lot of theoretical questions, but I didn't understand his accent, as it was a pure Chinese English accent. Even after he repeated a question for the fourth time, I replied I don't know, though I didn't understand his question.  The interview was around 45 minutes. It was my first interview, and I was just as nervous. After 22 long days of quietness, they replied, \"No.\" I am sad. \nIELTS 7.0; Papers 3; No GRE, Centrally applied, BSc 3.32, MSc 3.25.",

You should check your application portal to confirm whether you have received either of these notifications. If you did not receive either notification, then you were on our waitlist, and we were hoping to be able to admit you. \n\nHowever, at this point, we have made all the offers we expect to make for the Fall 2025 semester. Due to the statewide hiring freeze by the governor of Louisiana, we will not be making any offers after April 12. The earliest we may resume the process is in July, barring any extensions of the hiring freeze. \n\nI\u2019ve accepted an offer at another school anyways but just wanted my answer.

Acceptances will continue to roll out. My best wishes to everyone. Remember to be intentional about your grad cafe use. If it\u2019s starting to make you even more anxious (like it did with me!), I suggesting creating some limits for yourself around your usage :)  Best of luck everyone!!!",

Cited \"federal funding uncertainty\" and a larger than usual class compared to last year as the main reasons.\n\nemail extract:\n\"You are one of about 50 students who has neither been admitted nor denied admission to the CU Boulder physics Ph.D. program.  Last year, we ended up with a very large incoming class of 80 students compared to our target of 60.  Last year we admitted 248 students.  To compensate for last year and to be conservative given the uncertainty in federal funding, we have admitted only 123 out of 1224 applications. In a normal year, nearly all of you would be admitted to our program.  Unfortunately, this is not a normal year.  The reason that we have kept your application active is in case it seems that our entering class will be even smaller than our target.  If that were to occur, we may be able to admit a handful of you.\"",

After a holistic and comprehensive review of all your application materials, we regret to inform you that we are unable to offer you admission at this time. The UC Berkeley campus has a strict enrollment ceiling, and we are thus very limited in the number of new students we may admit each year. The admissions committee in the program you applied to had the difficult task of selecting students with the strongest overall records from a large pool of well-qualified applicants. Unfortunately, this may result in not being able to accept many applicants who are capable or have the potential for excellent academic work. We are sorry we do not have a place for you in this year\u2019s class. We appreciate the interest you have shown in UC Berkeley and wish you every success in your future endeavors.",

Submitted my application in Nov for Dec 1 deadline though Breana didn\u2019t process my application till Dec 15 even after repetitive emails. In the meantime I also emailed my POI Tiffany A Koszalka, who gave me typical reply of all faculty evaluating process, no interest was shown. On Jan 28 I emailed Huang & Breana, off which Breana replied immediately noting a decision will be made on 15 feb, just after 4 hours I received a rejection notification. Next day Huang replied saying the application is still under review. I escalated the issue to the dean and after nobody has replied. I came to know from other students that they only prefer their masters students and external students are only invited to inflate the application numbers. I unnecessarily lost my application fee.",
